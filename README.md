# ToDoBattles
This is the repository where I upload all the changes I make to my project "ToDoBattles!"

The main target of "ToDoBattles!" is to create a interactive To-Do webapplication that anyone, with or without a lot of technical knownledge, can host provatly from any device. So it should be lightweigh, low maitenance and still customisable. And most importantly, it should be free.

My personal target is to learn how to create a good webapplication, with a front and backend, learn new technologies (atleast new to me ðŸ˜‰) and to create a project that anyone can use to learn things about the same technologies.

Feel free to copy my idea, my code, my graphics ect. since I got inspired to do this by other applications too. Just keep the main target of this project in mind.
